Notes on DC functionality
-pre-processing:
    -uses mean absolute value to get intensity
    graspOAmp = mean(abs(graspO)); % get intensity of channel 1 data
    graspCAmp = mean(abs(graspC)); % get intensity of channel 2 data    

-contraction threshold
    -based on arbitrary slider
    -maybe 75% of mvc?
    co = app.CoContractionSlider.Value; % upper threshold for co-contractions
